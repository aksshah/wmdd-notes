# wmdd4999 assignment 4 twilio

Starting with the project that you created for assignment 3, which adds
information about a file added to an S3 bucket to DynamoDB table. You are going
to add the additional functionality of sending an SMS message when a new file is
added to your S3 bucket.

This SMS message should include the name of the file. ie "the new file 'cat.jpg' was added to your S3 bucket"

This should be a separate function built with the serverless framework, so your
project now has a function that notifies you when a file was added to S3 via SMS
in addition to the previous function that adds that file information to a
DynamoDB table.
